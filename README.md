# 8086x-lite-assembler
A simulated processor with small memory and registers using a very extremely lite 8086x assembly code

Part 6:	Input 10 numbers into an array which are bigger than 0 or smaller than 100, add them and output the sum

Part 7:	Input 10 numbers into an array which are bigger than 0 or smaller than 100, add them and return sum by reference

Part 8:	Input 10 numbers into an array and sort them using bubble sort

Part 9:	Create a linked list, user inputs numbers until he enters 0 or exceeds the memory limit

Commands:
1. mov reg constant
2. mov reg reg
3. mov reg address
4. mov address reg
5. add reg []
6. add reg constant
7. add reg reg
8. cmp reg reg
